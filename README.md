## Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
### Objective:
Perform an exploratory data analysis on the given dataset to derive meaningful business insights.

### Key Steps:
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning.
2. Visualizations to identify trends and patterns.
3. Extraction of 5 key business insights, each summarized concisely.

### Deliverables:
- A **Jupyter Notebook/Python script** containing EDA code.
- A **PDF report** summarizing business insights.

## Task 2: Lookalike Model
### Objective:
Develop a Lookalike Model to recommend similar customers based on profile and transaction data.

### Key Steps:
1. Preprocessing and feature engineering using customer and product information.
2. Implementation of similarity measures to recommend top 3 lookalike customers for each user.
3. Calculation of similarity scores for recommendations.

### Deliverables:
- A **Jupyter Notebook/Python script** explaining the model development.
- A **Lookalike.csv** containing recommendations for the first 20 customers (CustomerID: C0001 - C0020).

## Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
### Objective:
Segment customers into meaningful groups using clustering techniques.

### Key Steps:
1. Preprocessing of customer profiles and transaction data.
2. Selection and implementation of a clustering algorithm (with a range of 2 to 10 clusters).
3. Calculation of clustering metrics, including the **Davies-Bouldin Index (DB Index)**.
4. Visualization of the clusters.

### Deliverables:
- A **Jupyter Notebook/Python script** containing clustering code.
- A report including:
  - Number of clusters formed.
  - DB Index value.
  - Other clustering metrics.
  - Visualizations of the clusters.
